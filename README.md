# FABRIC Testbed Scripts

[FABRIC Testbed](https://fabric-testbed.net/) is a nation-wide testbed supporting advanced networking, application, and security research funded by the US National Science Foundation.
Its everywhere-programmable network can be controlled by [fablib](https://fabric-fablib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fablib.html) running on JupyterLab.
This repository collects scripts for my FABRIC experiments.
All contents are in the public domain and can be reused without limitation.
