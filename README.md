# FABRIC Testbed Scripts

[FABRIC Testbed](https://fabric-testbed.net/) is a nation-wide testbed supporting advanced networking, application, and security research funded by the US National Science Foundation.
Its everywhere-programmable network can be controlled by [fablib](https://fabric-fablib.readthedocs.io/) running on JupyterLab.
This repository collects scripts for my FABRIC experiments.
